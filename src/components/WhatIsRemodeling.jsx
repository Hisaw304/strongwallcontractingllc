            Redefining Exterior Remodeling
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            A home without thoughtful exterior design often feels incomplete,
            lacking personality and the welcoming charm every homeowner
            deserves. Exterior remodeling is more than a surface upgradeâ€”itâ€™s
            the key to enhancing curb appeal, increasing durability, and giving
            your space the style and comfort that make it truly feel like home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            From modern siding and durable roofing to energy-efficient windows
            and custom outdoor living areas, every detail plays a role in
            defining your homeâ€™s character. Remodeling is not just about looks;
            itâ€™s about functionality, improving comfort, and ensuring your home
            stands strong for years to come.
